summary:    Removing a lot from a minimal theme itself
categories: jekyll pixyll

Hello.

Pixyll is a simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll that emphasizes content rather than aesthetic fluff. It's mobile _first_, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.

It's pretty minimal, but leverages large type and drastic contrast to make a statement, on all devices.

## Where is it?

Checkout the [Github repository](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) to download it, request a feature, or report a bug.

It's free, and open source ([MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)).

Even though it is minimal, I further removed lots of things like disqus integration, social media icons, google analytics and so on. I think now the blog looks in good shape and I could freely express my thoughts here. Although, I am still not satisfied and will try harder to make it as minimal as possible, Thank you!
