Hi! Welcome to my blog! 

[Minimalism](http://mnmlist.com/) is the way to go, especially in the 21st Century with so much noise that it is hard to decipher the signal.

I do research. Look [here](https://aseembits93.github.io/)! 

Apart from research, I am very much into playing music, gymming, running, swimming and cycling. 

Checkout my music performances and research videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS-mAkSQheveU4dI78Sv1GQ), [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/aseem-saxena)! Find me on [Github](https://github.com/aseembits93)! or just shoot over an [email](mailto:aseem.bits@gmail.com)! I click photographs ocassionally - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aseemsaxena1/).

PS: A big thanks to John Otander for gifting the world this amazing [website theme](http://pixyll.com/)! 

Cheers!
